# Core writing values and big ideas

(Want a TL;DR version of how marketing should think of voice and tone? [Here you go](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Big%20Stuff/Voiceandtone.pdf) (PDF). You can get more from that presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/a/simple.com/folderview?id=0BzeOQB5ld5OZflJRY3ZxSklaZ3gxbmtWellXVld5OHhhd3lfZjYteTlzQ1dKeGhhRmpzc0E&usp=sharing))

## Money is inherently, inescapably emotional

Seems obvious, doesn't it? You think about money in almost any decision you make, large or small. You plan your future around money. You view your own self-worth in part based on your financial situation. So why do so many banks use dry, unemotional, detached language to speak to their customers? Our theory is that by acknowledging (overtly or not) the strong emotional associations people have to money, we can give them a more relatable and more trustworthy interaction.

In other words, we can validate people's emotional experiences around money. We can remove shame and guilt often associated with, for example, the simple act of checking one's account balance. Our whole goal is to make interacting with your finances a pleasant experience (or at least a non-awful one), so we should write, design, and build with **intention** and understanding of **context** of the person who's going to be interacting with Simple. To put it more plainly, **every time someone interacts with an element of Simple, they should get the sense that someone cared about them**, and took the time to imagine their situation.

TL;DR, we care about feelings. A lot.

### Feelings corollary: there are conscious and subconscious feelings.

We do best when we address both, even if not explicitly. For example, if someone is applying for Simple, they may be feeling annoyed or put-upon. "Ugh, how long is this going to take?" But they may be feeling something deeper, for instance, they may be wondering whether they can trust us with their money, or whether this new way of banking will *actaully* help them do better with their financial habits. That's some real shit, and while they may not be aware of it, we do well when we address both the surface-level stuff, and the more underlying stuff.

So how do we do this with copy specifically?

## The Informed Friend

The overall tone of all our communications (including the blog and emails to customers) should be that of an unassuming friend who also happens to be a financial expert. We've taken to calling this **"The Informed Friend"**. Not the know-it-all kind of friend, but your earnest friend who knows a lot--about both you *and* the financial world--and really wants to help. 

Every piece of text (unless it expressly needs to seem automated) should convey warmth, and be a subtle reminder that the heart of our company is the human beings who care about the users/readers/customers and their experiences with our product and web presence.

### How to write like an Informed Friend

We like to use a technique we call **"Proactive Empathy"**. Very simply, it means we consider the context of each and every interaction. There's a handy set of questions you can use to do proactive empathy:

1. What is the **conflict**? ("Conflict" in the literary sense; a person needs a thing and does not have it.)
2. How might someone **feel as they begin** this interaction? (surface and underlying?)
3. What might be some pitfalls or **barriers to their understanding**?
4. How do I want them to **feel at the end** of this interaction?
5. How can I **set them up for success**?

### More ways to write The Simple Way

**Be precise**. Use as few words as necessary to fully describe a concept. Be brief but comprehensive; sacrifice brevity before sacrificing comprehensiveness. And...

**Don’t lie by omission**. Banks do well enough by telling enough of the truth to cover their asses. We want to do good by being transparent. Unlike them, we have no policies or practices that are especially worth hiding. Err on the side of more information.

**Be humble**. We're awesome, but we should be showing it with our actions and compassion rather than talking about how great we are. 

**Write for a reasonable person**. Our customers are smart. We can treat them like adults. Their banks already alternate between obfuscation and talking down to them, depending on which is more convenient. Our customers are very capable of understanding even complex ideas, as long as they’re explained patiently, competently, and thoroughly.

**Write first, regulate second**. Our language will be subject to regulations and compliance standards. Our goals are to create a brand, educate our (future) customers, sell a product, and inspire emotional connection. Let our partners suggest edits to our copy, don’t try to internalize their voice and needs.

**Break the rules sometimes**. Is your mind blown that this is a rule?

*“Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.” - Vonnegut*

## Our audience

As I said above, our audience is smart. We should continue to assume this, stubbornly if necessary. On a daily basis, our audience is becoming more diverse in other regards. Currently, they tend to be tech-savvy, male, financially stable, and in their mid 20s or early 30s. We can keep that in mind, but not make it our focus. Understand that grandmas, the underbanked, high school students, and many others will continue to grow as a share of our audience. But we should never assume a drop in intelligence as our demographic changes. Talk to adults like adults.

## Common writing pitfalls in our industry
### *Or, The 3 Surprising Writing Mistakes You NEED to Know About!*

#### SLP
What I like to call **Skateboards Lasers Pizza**. Basically, schlocky and insincere marketing copy directed at children (and, increasingly, men), or rather, an ad exec’s cynical Platonic idea of what a child (or man, or manchild) thinks is cool. 

>![](https://simple-monosnap.s3.amazonaws.com/The_Itchy__Scratchy__Poochie_Show_64.JPG)
>
><i>Catch you on the flipside, dudemeisters. NOT!</i>

It could be *any* reductive, crass, insulting encapsulation of an entire demographic based solely on its purchasing preferences. "Skateboards Lasers Pizza" refers to the pew-pew fingerguns hip marketing of the late eighties and early nineties, but it could be any demographic. Think "Football Boobies Beer" or "Yoga Wine Tour Kale". You get it. 

Banks and “hip” web companies SLP all the time, and it’s immediately identifiable as false and cloying. We’re both a bank and a hip web company, but we’re also neither of those things. Phrases like “save up for that iPad you’ve been ogling” or “get wise to the latest ways to drop some cash” or “guys know that coupons are for chicks” are bad *and you should feel bad*.

There's more below in the section that talks about privilege, but SLP often veers into the territory of cultural appropriation. A general tip to avoid cultural appropriation: unless you are well-versed in the intracacies of the culture you're referencing, AND you can reference it respectfully, [don't do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMwyB1c_KEQ).

Imagine the 60-year-old white dude who thought this was a good idea because this how the kids are talking now, right?

><i>This is [a real McDonald's ad](http://www.ramblingbeachcat.com/2011/09/amazing-moments-in-advertising.html). This is what happens when you appropriate a culture you shouldn't.

Don't be that guy.

#### Assuming a narrow demographic
I’ve described our current demographic, but we should not write solely for them. If someone lives paycheck-to-paycheck or is new to the world of online banking, they might not personally identify with our copious coffee shops and Rdio subscriptions, but neither should our copy eye-rollingly imply “NOT FOR YOU” in its tone.

A corollary of this is being unaware of your **privilege**. So important when you're talking about financial matters. Most of us have privilege in some form or another. Whether you have male privilege, white privilege, economic privilege, or one of many other types, you need to constantly check it against your writing. For example, say you're writing a blog post on saving for a solo vacation. Keep in mind things like:
- Not everyone can afford a vacation, either financially or circumstantially. If you're going to advocate for cutting down on frivolous spending, keep in mind that some people *don't* spend frivolously and *still don't have enough*
- There are many places in the world that would be safe for a man to travel alone, but not a woman.
- Some people have disabilities that would prevent them from doing certain activities.
- People of color are often subject to vastly different applications of authority than white people.
- Gay or trans people might not be safe in places where straight or cisgender people would be welcome.
- People who have kids usually can't just drop everything and travel.

You get the idea. This doesn't *at all* mean you should avoid writing on this topic, nor does it mean that you need to be apologetic about the point of view you have. All it means is that you should have awareness of this as you write, and use language sensitively to couch your points and add strength to your argument. For example:
- Instead of "We could all probably cut a latte or two out of our weekly coffee habit", say "most of us could find areas where we can make small sacrifices to save substantially over time." The latter sentence isn't as punchy, of course, but it actually makes the argument better and more inclusively than the former sentence.

#### Wank Words and Bank Words

**Wank Words**

There’s no need to use words that have a simpler alternative. [Banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2TnOIAz9v8) and large corporations constantly use this kind of language to seem important and smart. It's an immediate turnoff to most normal humans. This ban does not apply to shades of meaning–-in very specific situations, these words really are the best choices. Mostly never, though. 

Examples:
Utilize, formulate, implement, ideate, leverage, impactfulness

>*Make actionable inroads in the clarity space by ideating innovative solutions around reducing the impactfulness of customer dissat in a given business ecosystem.*

[Buzzwords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_buzzwords) are also Wank Words. Buzzwords depend on the context, but things that you're tired of hearing in your industry tend to count. Like "synergy", "viral", "responsive", and "disruption". Sometimes you'll need to talk about these topics, so a good rule of thumb is to not use them in a list of descriptors. Instead, talk about, say, "responsiveness" specifically in the context of design that's capable of changing to fit screen size.

Not all Wank Words are complicated or buzzwords! Here are some secret Wank Words:
- around (when used to mean “relating to”)
- space (when used to mean culture, topic, industry)
- shape (when used to mean “influence”)
- grow (when used to mean "expand", as a verb with a direct object that is not a plant; e.g. "grow your career" or "grow your personal wealth")

**Bank Words**

You know, the way banks and *literally no other entities on the planet* talk. This also includes overly formal language, unnessecary legalese, or generally anything completely tone deaf. This language can be insulting, because it's often used to mask or deflect emotion. It can come off sounding passive-aggressive, too. Ask yourself "would a human being *say* this to another human being?" If not, there's a good chance it will *read* false as well.

Examples:

> - *"We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."*

> - *"We regret to inform you that..."*

> - *"This service message was sent to you as a Chase customer to provide you with account updates and information about your Chase relationship."*
