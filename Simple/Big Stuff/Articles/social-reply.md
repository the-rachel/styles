### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Excited, happy, effusive, generous:** "I love you guys!"| **Affirmed:** "I still really love you guys!"|
| **Confused, interested, neutral, intrigued:** "Are you the right bank for me? Do you have the things I want?" "Do you have joint accounts? Can I open a savings account?" "I heard you had problems earlier this year-- all better now?"| **Confident:** "I could feel safe banking with you."|
| **Angry, enraged, frustrated, disappointed, disillusioned, needing to be heard:** ""You denied my application! Don't trust this bank!" "My card kept randomly declining for no reason! I really wanted to like you guys!" | **Heard, understood:** "I know Simple cares."|

### The underlying issues, and how to respond
1. They are happy. No real issue.

**Example Copy**
> *"Hey, Namey, thanks so much! We are so happy for your support!"*

**What we want to convey**
	- Gratitude and humility
	- We want to support their good feeling and help extend it. Humor and genuine kindness are useful here.

2. They're wary. They want to make sure their money is going to be safe and the investment they need to make to switch is going to be a worthwhile one.

**Example Copy**
> *"Hey, Person. Totally understand where you're coming from on that one. We did have problems earlier this year, and the vast majority of the issues have been resolved. We are excited to have new customers and we hope we can show you what we've been working on."*

**What we want to convey**
- Honesty. There's no reason to be cagey unless we're speculating on future releases or talking about personal info.
- Empathy. We can set ourselves apart from other banks' social media presences by being personal and informal, while still knowing our shit. 
- Trustworthiness-- hopefully by doing the above we can feel trustworthy.

3. They've likely been disappointed. They wanted to believe in us and trust us, and for whatever reason they feel they can't now. They're on Facebook because they need to be heard.

**Example Copy**
> *"Hi, Name Guy. I hear you. That sounds frustrating, and I'm sorry you had that experience! I see you've gotten in touch with us via support message, and while I can't address your specific issue on Facebook, I can say we've got some ways to work with you to figure this out."

**What we want to convey**
- Understanding, acknowledgement of their unhappiness
- I hear you.
- I am solutions-minded.
- If they still have a problem, send them to support asap.
