## Application Page

### Feelings

|On the surface, the reader might be feeling... | And we want to make them to feel... |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Skeptical, skittish, hesitant:** 
"What is this new bank and why do they want every personal detail about me?"| **Reassured:** "I understand why this information is needed, and I feel comfortable giving it."|
| **Excited, eager:** "aw yiss time to get a new bank"| **Reinforced:** "This is going to be painless."|

### Our copy should focus on:
The skeptical, skittish person should be reassured by both the friendly tone and the get-down-to-business attitude these pages will convey. The explainer text should be straightforward and easy to understand, while the application itself should seem bank-y.

#### Other things to consider: 
The power dynamics here are unequal. in reality, the applicant has all the power: we need new customers, and it’s ultimately their choice. It’s ours to lose. However, they will FEEL at our mercy: we are asking for all their personal info, on the internet, after possibly just having met them (the average person stays on our website for only a couple of minutes before either leaving or signing up). Whether they choose to continue with the application or not, making them feel empowered will help them feel as though they’ve made the best choice. 

### To address deeper feelings, we want to convey:
- **Reassurance, understanding, trustworthiness:** we know this could feel a little daunting, but you can trust us to keep your information safe.
- **Seriousness, security:** we're not just a friendly internet company, we're also a bank. You should feel safe keeping your money here.
- **You're signing up for a bank account:** some people don't realize that, and are jarred by the personal information we request.

### Important words or phrases to use:
- "Apply" - remind them again that they're applying, not receiving an account.
- "We" - friendly and helpful
