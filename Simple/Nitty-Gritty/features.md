###On Capitalization

*In general*, a term is capitalized if it refers to a specific area of our product, or a specific feature. If you can navigate to or direct your gaze to a concrete section of the product, it's probably capitalized. For example, **Scheduled Activity** (capitalized) is the name of the section where you can view your scheduled transactions. A **scheduled activity** (not capitalized) is a transaction you have coming up. **External Accounts** (capitalized) is the section of your Simple account where you view your **external accounts** (not capitalized). You'd click on Support Articles (the section) to read our support articles (the articles themselves). AND SO FORTH.

*Exceptions to this rule* are generally items that are part of a large feature that we have named. This can get tricky because we like really basic names 'round hurr. The best examples are Goals and Reports. We call External Accounts that because that's what it is&mdash;at any bank, you could talk about external accounts and be talking about basically the same thing. Goals, though, is a feature and a name that we came up with, so each Goal is part of our Goals feature. 

*Incarnations of words* relating to a feature name aren't generally capitalized, even if they're part of that feature's name. For example, you go to Block Card (capitalized) to block your card (not capitalized) or put a block on your card (not capitalized). In the Transaction View (capitalized) you can view information about your transaction (not capitalized). 

*Customer Relations* is capitalized because there's no industry-standard name for this team or concept. Some places call it Support or Customer Support or Customer Care. Our team is called Customer Relations, but every marketing team is a marketing team. 

##In-depth Glossary

###Goals
Our feature is called "Goals". The first time it's mentioned in a particular piece of communication, you may need to give it context, such as calling it "our Goals feature". Thereafter, you should just call it Goals, if you can. Goals is actually singular&mdash;as in "Goals is a fun, flexible tool for budgeting and saving." Individual Goals are capitalized, as in "I set a Goal to quit my job and become a farmer." However, if you're talking about the concept of savings goals, don't capitalize, even in the context of our Goals feature. For example:
> *Safe-to-SpendÂ® gives you a more complete picture of your account. It takes your current balance, then subtracts your savings goals, upcoming payments, and pending transactions.*

This would be a great way to explain Safe-to-Spend to someone who's never heard of the concept. As this person doesn't know that we have a feature called "Goals", "savings goals" isn't capitalized. However:
> *Safe-to-Spend takes your current balance, then subtracts your Goals, scheduled payments, and pending transactions.*

Slightly different sentence, but for someone who's more familiar with our product. They know we have a feature called Goals, and you can schedule payments with Simple. Subtle, but important.
