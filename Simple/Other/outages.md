#Responding to an outage with WORDS.
(except the word "outage")


#What's an outage?

Anytime one of our services or our partners' services are not functioning properly, in such a way that the customer experience is negatively affected.

**In General**

- Minimize your use of apologies. They sound insincere when they are the automatic response to a customer's unhappiness. We want to save our apologies for when we've *really* fucked up. Also, sometimes it's just not really that big a deal, and you need to explain that to the customer, who, by the way, is *not* always right.
- Stay fresh. You're about to answer the same question 534 times. But the person you're talking to only has it one time. Their emotions are real.
- Let everyone know that we're aware of the issue and we're working on it. If there's a time estimate, tell them right away, even if they don't ask.
- Each situation will have specifics. The language below is general, and should be supplemented with more specifics. For example, "you can't schedule a payment right now, but you should be able to in about an hour." Or, "our check processing partner is experiencing an issue right now, and we're working with them to have it fixed soon."


The two biggest rules are encapsulated in this image:

**Why don't we say "outage"?** Good question! We're big fans of transparency and telling it like it is, right? So why wouldn't we call an outage an outage. Couple'a reasons: one, it's not very specific. We can be more precise, and that will give the customer more handle on what's *actually* going on. Two, it's panic-inducing. Panic is bad. We don't want that.

**The ultimate goal of outage communication is to give the customer all the information we can so that they can feel as in control/informed as possible. More control=less panic=fewer unhappy customers.**



#Common Outage Types, and some GENERAL language for 'em:

##Processor outage, AKA oh fuck 

- This means TxVia is down, and our customers are unable to access their funds, use thier cards, or pretty much do anything at all.
- Like apologizing? Here's your chance!
- We own our uptime, and as such we own the customer experience, bad or good. However, when TxVia is down, it's ok to distance ourselves slightly from them, as we are about to switch over to a new processor. Tips on how to do this are outlined below. Basically it just means you can mention them if it's relevant-- not throw 'em under the bus. This way, we will be able to make a more compelling case for greater reliability after the processor switch has happened.

###Some things to say:

- Our card processor is experiencing an issue. We're working on it and we hope to have an update for you very soon.
- Unfortunately, the only thing I can recommend is using another card right now.
- I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. We're doing everything we can to fix it.
- We know this is unacceptable. We're thankful for your patience.

###Some things to do:
- Make sure there is someone dedicated to Twitter
- Take note of anyone experiencing especially shitty things. Being stuck at the grocery store, or a restaurant, with no way to pay, is terrible. We can do nice things for them later.
- Stay calm and empathetic. Do not rush through helping a customer even though things are busy. Remember, this customer's financial world is possibly on fire. They cannot access THEIR OWN MONEY. You may have dealt with 408 panicked customers already, but this is their one and only time talking to you. Do not let *them* know that you are sick of talking about this.
- This is a big deal, and while you should not forget that this is pretty much the worst thing we could do to them, the best and only thing we can do is be patient, calm, and conciliatory. Listen. Take the time. Don't hurry them. Literally the only thing we can do is be kind and hope they don't hate us too much.

##ACH file delay:
- This means that the file that Bancorp runs to process people's ACH transfers (like their direct deposit) has been delayed. 
- This sucks
- People are expecting their money to be in their account and it isn't. But it's not lost and it's on the way.

###Some things to say:

- We're definitely aware of the issue and we're working with our partner bank to resolve it. 
- There was a delay processing electronic transfers from our partner bank this morning, and the money is on its way.
- I know this is very frustrating, and I'm sorry. (Was your paycheck delayed too? Feel free to say so!)

###Some things to do:

- Make sure the person watching Twitter is monitoring a little more closely than usual.
- Recall the rules of freshness: you'll repeat yourself 50 more times after this, the person hearing it will ALWAYS be hearing it for the first time. You know this is about ACH files, but the person you're talking to isn't really likely to know WTF an ACH file is.
- Be apologetic, but not too much. Yeah it sucks that their money wasn't there at 7am, but it'll be there! People are usually angry because of their initial panic that their paycheck was gone. It definitely does suck that it wasn't there when they expected it, but a fix is on its way. There's not a lot we can do, because the issue is usually already fixed.


##Simple-side issue (we dun fucked up)
- IN GENERAL, this means that one of our internal services is down. Maybe customers can't log in, maybe their Activity isn't updating, maybe they can't send a payment. IN GENERAL, their money is safe, their information is safe, and their ability to use their card is unaffected. You will know if one of these things isn't true.
- Usually the all-seeing eye of ops already knows about it. 

###Some things to say:
- Your funds and information are safe, you just can't see them right now.
- We're working on it, and we expect to have an update for you soon.
- You can still use your card as normal


###Some things to do:
- Keep an eye on the Tweetars.
- Don't apologize too much, especially if all that's happening is they can't see their information. Maybe a little if some functionality of the service is unavailable, such as RDC.
