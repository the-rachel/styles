## Background and intention
> *Rachel’s note: I really enjoyed my conversation with you! I especially loved meeting with Jocelyn in New York; her passion and excitement informed a lot about this report, and gave a lot of life to what could otherwise be a dry topic. In our first conversation, you noted that while HelloBlackbox had done some exploration around the brand and the product’s value proposition, you were having trouble finding a unified and simple way to express it all.*

> *What you really wanted from brand strategy, I feel, was some deeper thinking that could inform marketing and positioning decisions, and be used to help get partners and collaborators up to speed on who we are and how we think. I think it’d be helpful to start off with a little on what we know going into this analysis—because you’ve got a lot of great information!*

> *By the way, I use “we/us/our” throughout the analysis, because I like to think of this as a document that can be used to inform future internal documents. If you’d rather a more external point of view, please let me know—it definitely doesn’t bother me. I’ve found most of my clients appreciate the framing of this as a future internal document, but occasionally people prefer to, framing-wise, keep a consultant’s analysis separate from what they’ve done internally—this is very reasonable and tends to be a matter of preference, so please don’t hesitate to ask me to change it!*

The topic of enterprise software is, to most people, not super exciting. For us, it’s probably not what gets us out of bed, but we sure do spend a _lot_ of time learning just what makes enterprise software valuable to its users—who are, in turn, our clients. Here’s what we know already about HelloBlackbox:

From our market research, we learned that **_the people making the software decisions are often the people who will be directly using the software_**. We also learned that **_there’s a lot of uncertainty in the software-purchasing process_**, and **_it’s time-consuming_**. Our brand positioning document tells us a lot about what we should say—important points to hit and articulations of the problem, along with lots of specific data points about the state of enterprise software. It says we should focus on four themes in our marketing messaging: **_ease, time, quality, and discovery_**. The services overview details the important product features of HelloBlackbox: **_comprehensive original research, unbiased data, a sophisticated algorithm, and personalization_**. It also talks about our approach to optionally adding a human analyst to our software product. 

We have our mission, vision, and values:

**Mission:**<br>
*Building a human interface to deliver personalized software results*

**Vision:**<br>
*Giving people what they really want, not what they ask for*

**Values:**
* *No Bullshit: Clear and Truthful*
* *Fair: Strive to be unbiased*
* *Supportive: We make each other and our customers look good. We believe success is not a zero sum game*
* *Work smart not hard*

So we have a lot to work from! The purpose of this analysis, then, is not really to rehash all of this from a new perspective, it’s to give it some framing, make it all actionable. We know a lot about what we do; this document will get into more of the *why* and *how* behind the ways we express ourselves as a brand. From here, we should be able to build out some internal resources, like writing style guides and brand briefing documents for collaborators. We should also have a better sense of how we put all the things in the above documents into action in a way that’s authentically us.

### How does HelloBlackbox make money?

How a brand makes their money informs how they will treat you as a customer. The ideal is for a brand’s incentives to be aligned with the customer. So let’s put HelloBlackbox in those terms: how do we express our profit model in terms of how it manifests in our brand?

**Suggestion:** HelloBlackbox makes money when our customers are satisfied, informed, prepared, and confident. We provide them value when we give them better, more personalized information than they could get on their own, for less money and time than with a consultant, and with more respect and trust than the sales reps they’re talking to. 

## Our audience
**Busy professionals with a big responsibility:** Even with the largest-scale enterprise software, the messaging, ultimately, is received by an audience of one. One person who’s tasked with a decision about what’s best for their team, but also for the company’s bottom line. This person probably has a direct stake in this software choice—likely, they will have to use it every day, and if they don’t, their team will. As our background research noted, these folks are used to dealing with vendors and fielding (actually, usually ignoring) sales calls and emails. They’re used to spending a lot of time and mental and emotional energy on finding software. And they’re usually not sure if they’re satisfied—either with the process or with their ultimate choice. They know the ins and outs of their use case, and they might have a bit of trouble getting out of the weeds of their everyday usage when they’re trying to envision the big picture.

**The meta audience:** This might be a bit of a cheat. At core, the question of our audience is pretty easy: we’re talking to one—helpfully—relatively specific persona. But they will always be acutely aware that they, quite likely, are not just thinking about their own needs: most people who use HelloBlackbox will ultimately have to convey their findings, needs, and decisions to someone else. So whether they’re at a tiny startup or a giant enterprise, our audience is going to be thinking about *their* audience as they go through our product. 

Their audience? Their direct boss. Their boss’s boss. The CEO. The team who will have to learn and use the new software. The tech team responsible for implementing the integration. Almost everyone using HelloBlackbox is going to have at least one of those stakeholders to whom they’ll need to convey their choice. And of course, to a lesser extent? In some cases, they’ll be thinking about the end user, too. For something like email marketing or customer service, our audience has the additional pressure of finding something that will enable them to provide a great product and service to their customer. 

Maybe they’ll need to justify it financially, maybe they’ll need to justify the technical or training expenditure, but they are going to have to talk about what they’ve learned. They’ll be looking for information that not only convinces and satisfies them, but gives them confidence that they can pitch it successfully to someone with less familiarity and expertise.

### How are they likely to feel coming into their interaction with us?
> *Ideally, this will align well with the “how we make money” section...*

Based on our background research, we know it’s probably not great: many of them have searched for software before, and they didn’t enjoy the experience. They may feel they have a tedious process ahead of them where they expect to feel bored, disrespected, uncertain, and overwhelmed. 

The vendor companies our customers are dealing with know the devil is in the details—they know you have some specific use cases you’re wondering about—which is why they make you give them something valuable (your time) in order to get that vital information. People end up feeling a little used and taken advantage of. We heard a sentiment like “I spent so much time and energy on this, and I’m still not super confident that I made the best choice.” That’s absurd—these people are actually experts in what they do all day, and in theory, it should be possible for them to feel empowered and prepared. But they know the tech landscape is going to continue to make them feel discouraged—it changes fast, and it’s often deliberately difficult to compare products to each other.

Add to that the fact that, even if they feel uncertain, or like they just made a random choice in the end, they’re going to have to present and justify their choice to someone else. They may not understand very well what this product does, despite having spent hours learning about it. They may not be totally sure it will cover their use cases, even though they had an opportunity to ask a salesperson that question directly. And even so, they will have to explain and defend this software to others. That’s stressful, and can feel like being set up to fail.

## Editorial voice

> *Rachel’s note: When I do these brand analyses, my suggestion for editorial voice is usually a person; adjective and noun. For example, for data-driven personalized skincare—Gentle Genius. For an event aggregator app—Enthusiastic Local. It’s basically a metaphor that you can stretch to ridiculous lengths to help inform your writing. It’s definitely a little cheesy, but it’s kinda meant to be: it’s to give you a character you can easily envision, so you can ask yourself: how would **they** say this?*

> *Then, I take the metaphor and actually do stretch it to its breaking point, in order to show how we can use the voice to make decisions about the way we present ourselves.*

> *This tends to be really subjective, so I don’t mind if you feel like I got it wrong! This is a suggestion based on what I’ve been able to glean from the tone you already project, so if it doesn’t quite resonate with you, let’s have a conversation about the kind of tone you want to project.*

> *My suggestion for HelloBlackbox: **Refreshing Researcher** (I didn’t try to make it a cutesy alliteration but sometimes these things happen).*

The editorial voice helps us decide how we want to address the people we just described above. We thought a little about how they might feel coming into an interaction with us. So a good question is: who do you want to meet, when you’re feeling that way? Naming the editorial voice for a person gives us a metaphor that we can stretch to ridiculous lengths to help inform our writing. It’s definitely a little cheesy, but it’s kinda meant to be: it’s to give us a character we can easily envision, so we can ask ourselves: how would they say this?

Someone you might want to meet is the **_Refreshing Researcher_**. Let’s vibe on it a little.

**Refreshing.** Have you ever had some kind of complex issue that you thought would never get resolved, because you’ve completely lost faith in things like cable company customer service, or competence at the DMV? But then your call just so happens to be answered by a literal (ie figurative) angel who has worked there for 25 years, knows the ins and outs, has seen this before a hundred times, and knows it’s going to end just fine? They verbally take your hand and go, “honey, don’t you worry; you and I are gonna solve this, and you’re going to be fine.” Maybe they’re kinda sassy; they cut right through the bullshit in their speech and are informal in a way that’s a pleasant surprise. But it doesn’t  make them look unprofessional, because they earn that kind of confidence—they know their shit backwards and forwards. That kind of refreshing. 

That’s how we want our customers to feel: when they get started with HelloBlackbox, even if they initially felt discouraged, they immediately feel our confidence in our knowledge—and theirs. They know we’re here to help them make this overwhelming thing feel manageable and purposeful. We not only tell them *what* fits for them, but *why it fits*, the kind of knowledge we have from experience combining and comparing different factors over and over. And they know we’re going to be honest with them; a bright light in the darkness of sales-speak and tech jargon.

**_Researcher._** We’ve done our research, and in that sense we’re obviously researchers. But more than that, we mean ‘researcher’ as a way to engage with the world. Someone who delights in objectivity; they consider it a challenge and a duty to remain as unbiased as possible and let the information speak for itself. They constantly check themselves: *am I looking for what I want to see, or am I letting the data tell me?* They tend to enjoy getting to the bottom of a question. They are enthusiastic about what they know; they are willing to say “I’ve actually done some research on that!”—and they’re excited to share what they’ve found. 

The best researchers are researchers no matter what they’re doing. If they find a new favorite TV show or movie they like, they read all about the actors, the production, the story, etc. If they get pregnant, they learn all they can about what’s happening inside their body. If their car breaks down, they know they don’t know enough to fix it, but they can research well enough to understand what happened. They’ve seen how much information is available about every topic under the sun, so while they’re confident in their knowledge, they remain humble. They know better than most how very little, in the scheme of things, they (and we, as humans) actually know for sure, so they are always ready to consider new information. And from a life spent with a true love of knowledge, they know what is a reliable source and what isn’t; they’ve seen how people use statistics to lie, or bend the truth to fit with their worldview rather than the other way around. They’re experts at filtering to find the truest truth they’re able to assemble with what they know. And they don’t sugarcoat it.

Most importantly, they know that as powerful as information is, it’s useless if you can’t put it into action and give it context. They don’t just know, they know *why* and *how*. They’re not simply an encyclopedia of facts, they seek to apply their knowledge; not just knowing, but solving problems.

That’s what we want to project to our audience: genuine curiosity, and true satisfaction from painting the most accurate picture possible. We not only know the information, we know how to make that information useful and actionable. We don’t just have data, we have context.

### What it is, what it isn’t
> *Rachel’s note: When we talk about what the voice sounds like, I like to give some adjectives to describe what it is and what it is not. My goal with this section is to use concepts that describe a way someone might talk in a marketing context. For instance, I could say “the voice is not patronizing,” but that’s gonna be true for just about every business in the world: customers, shockingly, don’t like being condescended to. However, if I say “the voice is not formal,” that gives you something to go on—there are many brands for whom it would be very appropriate to speak formally, we’re just not one of them.*

**The voice is:** enthusiastic, direct, confident, succinct, candid, informed

**The voice is not:** perky, gentle, elaborate, formal, exhaustive

**Put a different way:**<br>
Candid, but not catty.<br>
Succinct, but not terse or incomplete.<br>
Confident, but not overbearing—you’re the ultimate expert.<br>
Direct, but not harsh or hurried.<br>
Enthusiastic, but not trying to be your friend.

## Branding and messaging themes

Our brand positioning document lays out some themes to hit in our marketing messaging: ease, time, quality, and discovery. All, of course, vitally important—every product ever sold is going to have to address the first three, and the fourth is the main thing our platform does. So with this section, we’re going to plan out how we talk about those things. Think of the below concepts as inroads to addressing the value proposition of HelloBlackbox. In other words, think of them as ways we use the editorial voice (the person you want to meet when you’re feeling the way our audience feels) to talk to our audience.

**This is all we do.** We’re not here to sell you a specific product, we make our money when you’re happy with how our product works—that is, informed, empowered, and confident. Our time is spent researching to the smallest detail so we can make you a recommendation that’s based on your specific need, after doing millions of simulations to compare different scenarios. We don’t partner with vendors; they aren’t our client. You are.

**We know you know.** Remember, our customer is in an atmosphere where they have to set up a half-hour long demo with a salesperson just to find out the specifics of what a thing does. They feel like the vendor is selling them on the features their product has rather than listening to the features they need. That can feel bad, and even kinda gaslight-y, because the customer truly is the expert on what they do with the software, and truly does have their entire organization’s needs in mind. So HelloBlackbox should talk to them like they really do know their shit, you know, because they do. And they will feel prepared for the discussions they have ahead of them.

**We thought you might ask that!** The reason our customers go through all that bullshit with demos is they have some really specific question, and they want to know the ins and outs of how a product might work for their use case. The features list on the vendor’s website wasn’t enough to tell them whether the product is a fit, so we need to show them in all we do that we have way more information than that. We learned all their industry jargon enough to cut through it and find out what really works. And we’re not simply filtering the data—we’re running millions of comparisons based on all the details they gave us, so we’ve personalized it for the specific need they’re asking about. Their use case is unique and nuanced (that’s why Google doesn’t help much); we know there are a bunch of caveats and what-ifs and uncertainties. We want them to see results that give real confidence that a product is a good candidate for their team (or not).  

**Time well spent.** People want to save time, for sure. But when you’re doing this search by yourself, it’s often a weeks- or months-long process and it’s slow and tedious. The time savings messaging shouldn’t make the product sound facile or under-featured; this is in all likelihood pretty personally important to the person we’re talking to. The customer likely wants to spend a decent amount of their time on this in order to feel like they’ve covered all the bases, they just want that time to be fruitful and satisfying. Plus, a product that takes a bit of time to explore well and thoroughly might feel more worth the price. Also, taking people out of the sales demo ecosystem shows them you value their time.

It’s not a failure on our part if they still have to schedule a demo after using HelloBlackbox—in fact, that’s kinda the point: to choose the demos that will be most relevant to you. Our survey showed that people appreciate an informative demo of a product that actually fits their needs, so we weed out the ones that definitely aren’t worth their time to empower them to spend their time usefully and purposefully.
