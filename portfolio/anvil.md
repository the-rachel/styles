##### *Anvil is a service that is helping people create digital versions of physical documents—no more sending a PDF back and forth; their clients can send forms and collect information with much less hassle. They also unify forms so if clients have to fill out multiple forms as part of, for example, a home-buying process, they only have to enter each piece of information (eg, name, address, date) once and it will be populated on each form that requires it.*

# Anvil brand analysis

Thanks so much for chatting with me and giving me materials to view. I’m excited to begin this discussion about Anvil’s brand positioning and the beginnings of its writers’ handbook. There’s a lot to chew on here, some of which may resonate with you and some of which may not. Please let me know your thoughts in either direction; this is also very helpful as a beginning for dialogue. Thanks for reviewing, and I’m excited to build off of this!


## Editorial Voice

**_Or, It Looks Like You’re Trying To Change The Way People Think About Paperwork_**

When I do these brand personality analyses, my suggestion for editorial voice is usually a person; adjective and noun. For example, for an online bank wanting to truly help its customers feel better about money-- Informed Friend. For an event aggregator app-- Enthusiastic Local. It doesn’t have to be that formula, but the voice should be something you can easily envision. It’s basically a metaphor that you can stretch to ridiculous lengths to figure out how you’re going to talk to people.

The more I thought about Anvil and the needs your voice, especially in the early days, is going to have to serve, the more my mind returned to an old friend. Hear me out here, because I know this might sound weird: I keep thinking of the way Anvil talks as kind of a less-irritating Clippy. I know it sounds weird, but I think Clippy is a fascinating piece of culture; something designed to help people learn a brand new tool (word processing) for something they’d been doing forever, something humans had been doing pretty much the same way for all of our history. People probably had a sense that the rise of the personal computer meant there was an easier way to write, but where to start?

In my opinion, Clippy got a bad rap. Clippy was irritating sometimes, for sure. The limitations of predictive software at the time meant it sometimes interrupted you when you didn’t need it, or gave advice about something you weren’t trying to do. But that part wasn’t Clippy’s fault. The idea itself is genius, and was sorely needed. Microsoft chose a friendly, animated paper clip—something familiar, but made ever more obsolete by the very technology for which it was the mascot. To me, this is what’s really cool about Clippy: it was born of a deep understanding of the need to transition people from a manual legacy technology to something completely digital—to change the entire way they think about committing words to paper.

Maybe Microsoft didn’t think of it like this, but in terms of adoption curves, the first widely-available word processing program, I’d imagine, would have had an extremely nasty dropoff of users as people went back to doing stuff the hard way. It’s so, so hard to radically change your way of doing something fundamental and entrenched, just to get more or less the same result as the thing you were doing before (typewriting, writing longhand, using less featured word processing programs). Why not just keep doing it the way you always have? The frustrating thing is, of course, that there’s so much more you can do with Word than with a typewriter, and once you see that, it becomes something without which you cannot function. Microsoft understood that, but the problem is that you can only learn about all those new capabilities once you understand what word processing even is, and the adoption-frustration dropoff point happens well before then.

There’s that fake Henry Ford quote, about how if he’d asked people what they’d wanted, he’d be building a faster horse. That speaks to people’s inability to think outside of established parameters. And it’s true: you can show people the Model T, and it’s obvious when they see it that it’s better than their buggy. But their brain’s gonna shut down the second they start thinking about how to move from horse to car. Clippy was an attempt to ease horse-drivers into their new Model Ts. (I don’t know if that’s the dumbest sentence I’ve ever written, but it’s possible.) 

I don’t mean to get too navel-gaze-y here, but I think for Anvil, it’s going to be really really crucial to communicate an understanding of the gap you’re trying to bridge. What you’re actually trying to do isn’t just replace paper forms with a digital equivalent. You’re trying to reconfigure the whole concept of filling out paperwork, of standardized information gathering. Once people see that, they will wonder how they ever got by with emailed PDFs. But first you have to move them through an adaptation process that’s going to sound harder than it actually is, because it’ll involve readjusting all their processes.

And the reason it’s Clippy specifically is that damn paper clip knew everything! You told it what you want to be able to do, and it gave you some options—importantly, you didn’t have to know the process, you just had to know what you wanted to accomplish. And it was there if you needed something you’d feel stupid asking otherwise; Clippy’s not going to judge you because you don’t know how to put words in bold text. That, and it was a friendly little presence in the bottom corner of your screen. 

I don’t know, maybe the Clippy thing doesn’t feel right to you, and if so, that’s okay—let’s talk about it. But “it looks like you’re trying to…” is kinda the theme of what you’re doing right now: gently bringing people out of their understanding of the way paperwork is done, and into a new understanding of information gathering.

To Recap:

**The voice is:** helpful, knowledgeable, a little geeky, friendly, unobtrusive, gracious

**The voice is not:** aggressive, assuming lots of prior knowledge, overly effusive, disinterested


## Our Audience

We’ll be talking to a wide range of people with the same core problem, but very different mindsets. The challenge will be creating copy that can appeal to all of them without alienating any of them. After chatting with you and reading through the materials you provided, here’s who it sounds like you have in mind:

Younger tech-savvy professionals who are frustrated by the legacy systems they work with. These folks are so-called digital natives who are used to thoughtfully designed web experiences. They’re probably just as frustrated as their clients. 
Administrative professionals who may not feel empowered to look for new tech. They might feel worried about exposing customer information to a web tool without permission, but they also might be desperate to try something new. The more proactive ones are likely to be younger and used to websites and technology where stuff just works.
Older, possibly Boomer-ish professionals who know there must be a better way. A lot of Boomers are web-savvy but might feel alienated by the visual and written style common for millennial-focused tech companies. Some might immediately understand the concept of Anvil, but some might feel like they have stupid questions. We want them to feel assured and supported. They’re in the right place, it’s okay and understandable if they don’t know how stuff works.

## Messaging/Branding Themes

Your marketing and copywriting needs will of course evolve over time. As you build out new features, expand your offering, hit customer milestones, or just are generally in the news, the substance of what you talk about will change. But there are always some company narratives that stay true in the long term and shape the direction of communication. Recording them now is important, especially as you grow: there will often be times when you’ll need to look back and think of the reasons you started doing this. These are the overarching themes that I suggest you use when you are talking about Anvil as a brand/company.

### Efficiency

One of the primary feelings of frustration with the PDF-email way of doing things: as you’re doing it, you have this sense that there has to be an easier way than this. This is likely true even if you don’t know much about technology: it just seems so tedious, and you’re aware that beautiful and easy-to-use web products exist in abundance for other purposes. 

Efficiency is an important concept, because it’s the opposite of that feeling. Efficiency also neatly ties together the concepts of saving time, money, and frustration, in one framework. I think it’s good to keep them linked like that, for a couple of reasons.

One, those things will be very linked in the mind of the person reading this. The landscape for products like Anvil seems to be the classic “Fast [time]. Cheap [money]. Good [frustration]. Pick two.” Anvil actually does do all three.

Two, it’s more specific about how it will feel to use Anvil. Take the example of saving money, as if we were just talking about it by itself. Ever seen in the grocery store parking lot, the sign on the cart return--returning your own cart saves money! If you think about that for two seconds, it’s a little grim: if everyone returned their carts, supermarkets could fire most of their cart attendants. That’s the kind of vagueness we really want to avoid, because if we aren’t explicit about what ‘saving money’ means, it might sound like we’re implying that companies will be able to fire their data entry people. That might be the reality for some of our clients, but it’s definitely not a perception we want for the brand.

Instead, we should focus on efficiency, as though time/money/frustration are not separable from each other (and really, they’re not). All of these things encompass all three:

- Less time doing manual, clerical tasks
- Employees have more time to create/be proactive 
- Employees have increased job satisfaction because they’re getting to actually do their job instead of their job’s job, so to speak.
- Client turnaround times slashed dramatically
- Agents spend more time in the field, advisors spend more time doing research, etc.

  **Sample sentences:** *In the age of modern, elegant web experiences, the tediousness of paperwork feels almost wrong. Emailing PDFs back and forth, printing, scanning, faxing--you get the sense as you’re moving around physical sheets of paper that there’s got to be something better out there. We designed Anvil to be that better way. Your client fills out one form, and it’s automatically converted into the documents you need, instantly filed wherever it needs to go–even if you still need to fax, email, or upload customer information into your database. It integrates seamlessly with all the services you already use, so there’s no data entry needed. Your team spends more time doing the work that really matters, and your business sees the benefits.*

### Paperwork is important

We want to reduce paperwork; rethink the entire concept of information-gathering. However, we shouldn’t speak derisively of the concept of it. We have to thoughtfully tread a line between acknowledging that paperwork is a frustrating hassle that is currently far too manual, and making it seem like a useless or pointless task. This is for a few reasons:
- Most importantly, it’s not a useless or pointless task. This is powerful stuff, here. Our clients need this information to help people invest their money, or help them buy homes. Our stance should be that this information does big things, and making it easier to collect and manipulate makes bigger things easier to do. If anything, our tone should be a little quiet appreciation for the amazing things this information accomplishes.
- The real hassle of paperwork is not filling in the information. When we say “ugh, paperwork,” what we’re really frustrated with is the process. A good form makes information gathering painless at worst and kind of nice at best. So: yay for efficient movement of information. Fuck fax machines.
- Some portion of our audience will be data entry or admin folks. Another portion of our audience will be people who manage or employ data entry or admin folks. Those jobs are not useless or unimportant. We’d like to make the task obsolete, but the underlying message should be that the people who currently do that task, whether it’s their whole job or just a tiny part of it, are valuable and could be utilized better.
- And of course, following on all the above, Anvil’s work is important. If we talk shit about paperwork, we’re doing ourselves a disservice; the thing that we spend all our time thinking about should be something important and necessary. If we make information gathering (rather than the process) seem trivial or tedious, then we’re devaluing the work we do to make that task easier.

  **Sample sentences:** *On the average business day, you’ve got big things to accomplish for your clients—you help them with some of the biggest decisions they’ll make. For things that serious, there’s always a lot of paperwork—in a sense, paperwork changes lives. And while the humble, noble PDF has long been the standard for collecting information, it also requires that you spend a lot of time transcribing that information. Anvil simplifies all your paperwork into one secure, easy-to-use web form that’s easier for your clients and easier for you, so you can get out there and work more of your magic.*

### It’s all about the information

A good way to help people understand what Anvil does is to break paperwork down into its purpose: to collect, share, and record information. That’s what we’re doing when we fill out forms and do paperwork, and that’s also the big-picture vision for the product (to move beyond ‘paperwork replacement’ and become a system for information management). So, where it makes sense to do, let’s frame the product in terms of what we’re here to do—not replace forms, but manage information. This messaging might be more peppered throughout than primary. I know you already have images on the site but more visuals will probably be helpful with illustrating this concept. (I sketched one but I need to refine it a bit more before it’s ready for prime time.)

  **Sample sentences:** *Think about all the forms your clients need to fill out. How many times do they have to write their name and address? How many signatures? With Anvil, your clients only have to do it once: we gather all their information in one elegant, secure, easy-to-use form. Then, we upload that to your databases, and use the information to automatically generate each form you need to get your job done. We can even fax the forms to wherever they need to go, or trigger an action (like initiating a bank deposit, for example) once the form is submitted. It’s a new way to think about collecting client information—simple, secure, and so much faster.*

### We think about this a lot

It can sometimes be a little cloying and insincere sounding when companies adopt the ‘we are nerdy about [thing we produce that would be a weird thing to be nerdy about]’. In the case of Anvil, I think a light application of that tone is a good thing, because we are thinking about a thing that people would rather not spend too much time thinking about. It’s more convincing and comforting to people if they think someone has been thoughtful about something that they’d like to fade into the background. Plus, given that a large part of the selling point here is giving clients a digital experience, knowing that someone is dreaming up the nicest way to collect customer information is going to be a jolt of confidence.

**Sample sentences:** *We spend a lot of time thinking about the most elegant and enjoyable way to collect client information. We like to think of Anvil forms as thoughtful, sophisticated, and welcoming—we build the kind of experience we’d like to use, and one that will make your business shine.*

## Slogan Thoughts

You have two slogans, according to your messaging document:

- *Upload forms, get website.*
- *All your attachments in one link.*

These are good, although I think both could be better. “Upload forms, get website” isn’t exactly what Anvil does—I think “website” has a really specific meaning, and I think it gets muddled here. It’s not a homepage or even really a site. Similarly, ‘all your attachments in one link’ doesn’t really convey that the work is consolidated, streamlined, and simplified. So what do they get? One form to rule them all, pretty much.

You could go pretty straightforward:

*All your paperwork in one secure, easy-to-use form.*

You could get clever:

*Paperwork, without all the paper and work.* 

More esoteric:

*Form and function.*

Dead simple:

*Fill it out once and you’re done.*

Not NOT referencing LOTR:

*One form to close the deal.*

Maybe none of these is quite what you’re looking for, but I hope I’ve given you something to think about, and some good jumping off points.
