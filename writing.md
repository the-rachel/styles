#### Community guidelines

- [Call for community input on community guidelines](https://blog.dropleaf.io/we-need-your-input-on-our-community-guidelines-620b2770c9a6). (External link). I was Head of Community at dropleaf, a (now-defunct) indie games distribution startup. We aimed to take on the sometimes-toxic culture around gaming with the way we created community. This post is both a manifesto of sorts, and a draft of inclusive guidelines for creating supportive and fun community.


#### Ghostwriting

- ["You Are What You Do" blog post](https://blog.doing.io/you-are-what-you-do-e9da2d102709). (External link). This is a blog post I ghostwrote with edits from the team at Doing, an app focused on 'collecting the world's experiences.' The messaging and themes (namely "you are what you do") and the concepts presented in this post are my original work, done to help the team frame their narrative.
 
- [An apology blog post](https://www.simple.com/company/my-apology-to-you). (External link) As tech screw-up apologies have almost become a genre unto themselves, I was very proud of this post I ghostwrote for Simple's CEO. It meant a lot to him to get it right, so he trusted me absolutely to make sure we did. This was a pretty huge mess, and the post needed to explain some complex technical concepts, assure customers their accounts were safe, and demonstrate a genuine understanding of the impact.

- "[Temporary jobs that get you closer to your dreams](https://blog.instawork.com/temporary-jobs-that-get-you-closer-to-your-dreams-f6e50aa9064)." (External link). I ghostwrote this blog post spotlighting a gig worker who had been able to save enough money to buy a car.

- "[Rethinking E-Commerce Delivery In Emerging Markets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/10/16/rethinking-e-commerce-delivery-in-emerging-markets/#4dce41e566b8)." (External link). This is a *Forbes* article I ghostwrote for the author. It's a super-interesting examination of one-hour grocery delivery in the world's most densely populated city.

- "[How to Change Education (From the Ground Up)](https://blog.classdojo.com/how-to-change-education-from-the-ground-up/)." (External link). I ghostwrote this blog post with help from the ClassDojo leadership team. It's about ClassDojo's view of how to make K-12 education more democratic, interactive, and most importantly, lovable. 

#### Video script and taglines

- [An early video ad for Simple](https://vimeo.com/160291191). (External link). I was instrumental in developing the concept for this ad, helped write and edit the script, and wrote the tagline at the end.

#### Common language explanations of complex concepts

- [Welcome to Hippo letter and policy summary](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/portfolio/Hippo%20HO6%20Booklet%20(1).pdf) (PDF). This is a letter and policy summary I wrote for a client, [Hippo](https://myhippo.com/), which is a streamlined home insurance provider. Along with introducing new clients to the brand's voice and style, it was meant to provide a common language overview of their policy. This was written two years ago (as of September 2018) and with only minor edits, remains part of the welcome package that's sent to new customers.

- [Account agreement updates](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/portfolio/Gmail%20-%20Updates%20to%20your%20Simple%20Account%20Agreement.pdf) (PDF). When banks change their account agreements, they're required to let customers know. Simple always made sure to explain the changes in plain language. Here's a very early (2012) email I wrote to give an overview of the changes. 

#### Presentations

- [A presentation on empathy](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/empathy2.pdf) (PDF). This ties together a bunch of research and some of Simple's internal stuff for a talk on empathy. It focused a lot on customer service employees, who bear the brunt of empathy exhaustion, but was also given to people who design UX, write copy, or almost any customer-facing function. It talks about formulas and strategies for empathetic communication and design.

#### Informational research articles
Several of my clients have contracted me to create informational articles used for content marketing. I definitely don't see this as primarily SEO-focused (although it is, and I learned to pitch articles based on their SEO-friendliness). I want to actually provide value to the reader and show that the brand is informed, willing to give context and additional information when necessary to understand an issue fully. All of these are informational, but also showcase the brand's voice and values. It's also very important me to address taboo topics confidently, supportively, and open-mindedly, and to use gender-neutral language when talking about sexuality. This is just a few examples out of dozens I've written on a variety of topics. Most of these are not credited to me directly, but I wrote them. Let me know if you need proof of this!

- "[What Is Herpes?](https://www.heydoctor.com/learn/what-is-herpes)" (External link). I not only detail the facts about this oft-understood disease, I tackle the issue holistically, talking about how breaking the stigma around the disease is an important public health measure.

- "[Will My Parents Know If I Get A Birth Control Prescription With Their Insurance?](https://www.heydoctor.com/learn/will-my-parents-know)" (External link). Addresses the topic with depth and compassion, understanding that the reader of this article may be scared and trying to understand their options. 

- "[What is a Chiropractor? What does a Chiropractor Do?](https://beta.kenshohealth.com/guides/what-is-a-chiropractor-what-does-a-chiropractor-do)" (External link to beta site—will update when site goes live). Answers typical questions about chiropractors, details the history of the chiropractic profession, and reports on what medical science says about the practice.

- "[What Exactly is Gut Health?](https://beta.kenshohealth.com/guides/what-is-gut-health)" (External link to beta site—will update when site goes live). "Gut health" is all the rage right now in alternative health, and even in mainstream medicine. In this article, I break down what we do and don't know about it, helping to separate fact from magical thinking.

- "[What is Crystal Healing?](https://beta.kenshohealth.com/guides/what-is-crystal-healing)" (External link to beta site—will update when site goes live). Some people call it bullshit, some people say it's saved their lives. In this article I detail how it's bullshit, and talk about some current issues in the crystal healing industry. But I also do so in such a way that does not alienate people for whom crystal healing has been legitimately helpful. My general strategy when writing about woo-woo alternative health stuff: don't sugarcoat the truth, but validate believers who have found real benefit.

- "[What is Tantra?](https://beta.kenshohealth.com/guides/what-is-tantra)" (External link to beta site—will update when site goes live). I had a lot to cover in this: tantra wasn't originally about sex, and it's important for westerners to know how we got to the place we are today, where "tantra" is synonymous with slow, deliberate sex. But since most people reading this page would be looking to learn about tantric sex, there's also plenty of information about that in this article.


#### Other interesting writing

- "[Why I play: Crafting](https://blog.dropleaf.io/why-i-play-crafting-561825612d5a)." (External link). "Why I play" was a blog series we did at dropleaf, a Ycombinator startup, focused on indie video game distribution, where I was Head of Community. This post is about why crafting tasks in video games appeal to my ADD brain.

- "[Review: Dungeon Souls](https://blog.dropleaf.io/review-dungeon-souls-a74261a1cce5)." (External link). I play a video game genre I've never played before, and talk a bit about the genre and the specific game I was reviewing.

- "[That one tweet thread about the Golden Lovers, annotated](https://medium.com/we-need-to-talk-about-wrestling/that-one-tweet-thread-about-the-golden-lovers-annotated-e9fc604e3a7f)." (External link). I was really excited about my favorite pro wrestling tag team reuniting, so I wrote a tweet thread about their history, thinking that non-wrestling-fans would be interested to hear about a decade-long gay love story in Japanese pro wrestling. It blew up more than I could have imagined! This post is me embellishing on the tweet thread, and is still mostly understandable if you don't know anything about wrestling. I've been told by more people than I can count that my writing got them into (or brought them back to) wrestling. This tweet thread and essay were the reason I was featured in a Canadian documentary called "Omega Man: A Wrestling Love Story."

- "[Stars crossed - Tetsuya Naito and Kota Ibushi](https://www.njpw1972.com/52317)." (External link). This one is also about pro wrestling. My favorite thing about pro wrestling is the detailed storytelling—really! It exists! This is an essay I wrote for the world's second-largest pro wrestling promotion, about the history of the relationship between two of its biggest stars. It may not be terribly understandable if you're not familiar with the characters involved, but it's a great example of my ability to analyze the nuances of a story.

*******

Unfortuntely I don't have examples of work I did writing in-app copy, microcopy, tweets, Facebook and Instagram copy, and other such ephemeral things, as most of that work was done prior to my time as a freelancer. (And, to be honest I never thought to take screenshots of it! Oops.) However I do have extensive experience with all of those and more, and I'm happy to talk through my approach.
