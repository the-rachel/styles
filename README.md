# Rachel on Writing

This repository represents a collection of some of the work I've done to teach tech companies (usually fintech) to write in a way that is approachable, inclusive, and genuine. Over the course of my career it's been a personal and professional goal of mine to ensure that the companies I've represented are at the forefront of inclusive, intersectionally-just writing. Another huge goal of mine has been to teach the art of writing with empathy and true emotional intelligence. These things can't be faked or bought; they require the expertise of someone who has the company's values in mind as much as its bottom line. It also requires buy-in at many levels and a sincere understanding of the importance of inclusion and empathy.

A lot of this stuff is either IP of the company I worked for when I created it, or is in somewhat murky territory IP-wise. Much of it could be reworked to avoid IP stuff, but I haven't yet taken that step. Either way, it is pretty much just for the eyes of whoever has received the link to it. If anything here interests you, I would be happy to figure out how we could work it into something usable.

## Simple

The majority of my experience and examples come from Simple. I worked at [Simple](https://simple.com) for five and a half years. During that time, I originated and curated Simple's brand voice through writing, mentoring writers, and editing every imaginable piece of writing and copy, large and small. Most importantly, I ran the effort to identify Simple's company values, and wrote Simple's style guides, which in turn set groundwork for training programs for Marketing and Customer Relations teams.

### The curated list.

For a quick version, I'll highlight some of the things I think best represent my work with Simple.

- [Simple's core writing values](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Big%20Stuff/styleguide.md). Basically, if our style guide or voice and tone compendium have falied to provide you an answer, here are the things to think about when you're making writing decisions.

- [Simple voice and tone](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Big%20Stuff/voiceandtone.md). Owing a big debt of gratitude to Mailchimp's [voiceandtone.com](http://voiceandtone.com/), this is Simple's version, which is a whole lot more detailed because in general, money is more likely to be an emotional subject than email marketing. There are 30 articles about different cases in which a person might have to write copy. A good example is [this one](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Big%20Stuff/Articles/Application.md) on writing copy for the application to become a customer.

- [An abbreviated style guide](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Nitty-Gritty/strunkyfresh.md). This has the most commonly-needed rules on when to use certain types of punctuation, grammar, and all that.
 
- [A presentation on empathy](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/empathy2.pdf) (PDF). This ties together a bunch of research and some of our internal stuff for a talk on empathy. It focused a lot on customer service employees, who bear the brunt of empathy exhaustion, but was also given to people who design UX, write copy, or almost any customer-facing function. It talks about formulas and strategies for empathetic communication and design.

- [A presentation for the marketing team](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Voiceandtone.pdf) about how to talk to our audience, and how not to talk to anyone ever.

### The self-guided tour

Start [here](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Writing%20the%20Simple%20Way.md) for a directory representing what the How To Write repository looked like when I left Simple in May 2015. There are resources that give more of an overview of the philosophies of how we write, as well as specific examples of how to write copy for almost any occasion.

## Seed

Another useful set of guides that I have on hand as a good example of my work is the one I wrote for [Seed](https://seed.co). Though I now work full-time for Seed, this is something I did as a consultant for them. I was contracted to write marketing copy, do branding research, and help with job descriptions. As with many of my consulting gigs, I started with a quick writing guide and a document about overall messaging.

- [Seed writing principles](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Seed/seed-writing.md). A basic guide detailing the principles of writing for Seed.
- [Seed brand background](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Seed/seed-working.md). Some of the ideas behind the writing guide.

## Blaak

Blaak has now pivoted completely, and renamed themselves to [Vault](https://ivault.co). But back when they wanted to provide a [Betterment](http://www.betterment.com)- or [Wealthfront](http://www.wealthfront.com)-style personal investing service, I drafted [this](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Blaak/blaak.md) document to help them with their writing and brand direction.
