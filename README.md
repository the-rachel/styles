# Rachel on Writing

Hi, thanks for being here! You probably know that my name is Rachel, and I'm an expert writer and brand strategist. The two are very intertwined, of course, but you're probably looking for one or the other.

#### Of course, not everything I've ever written is here, so if there's a specific example of a type of writing you'd like to see that you don't see represented here, please feel free to get in touch about it! I can almost definitely find an example.

## [Brand and Content Strategy](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/brand.md)

As a consultant, I help my clients figure out their brand voice and how to execute on it. I guide the team through the navel-gaze-y big picture stuff all the way to specific execution strategies. This means I have crucial insight into marketing, customer service, organizational development, and product design—and I am very comfortable (and happy!) working at the hub where all of them intersect. I also write a *lot* of copy. 

This is also where you can find two of the presentations I wrote for internal brand guidance at Simple.

## [Writing Portfolio](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/writing.md)

I've written, ghostwritten, and/or edited every kind of copy you can imagine (and some you can't). Blog posts, web copy, essays, personal correspondence, articles for publication, in-app copy, social media posts, video scripts... whatever it is, I've done it.

In addition to my tech writing, here you'll find blog posts and articles I've written and ghostwritten, to get a sense of how I write, think, and adapt my style to fit the needs of the piece.
