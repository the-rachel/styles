# Rachel on Writing

This repository represents a collection of some of the work I've done to teach tech companies to write in a way that is approachable, inclusive, and genuine. Over the course of my career it's been a personal and professional goal of mine to ensure that the companies I've represented are at the forefront of inclusive, intersectionally-just writing. Another huge goal of mine has been to teach the art of writing with empathy and true emotional intelligence. These things can't be faked or bought; they require the expertise of someone who has the company's values in mind as much as its bottom line. It also requires buy-in at many levels and a sincere understanding of the importance of inclusion and empathy.

A lot of this stuff is either IP of the company I worked for when I created it, or is in somewhat murky territory IP-wise. Much of it could be reworked to avoid IP stuff, but I haven't yet taken that step. Either way, it is pretty much just for the eyes of whoever has received the link to it. If anything here interests you, I would be happy to figure out how we could work it into something usable.

## Doing
Doing ([doing.io](https://www.doing.io)) aims to aggregate experiences and events from all over the web into one unified platform. In the future, they hope to integrate with merchants and organizations to help them promote their activity calendars. I worked with Doing to hone their brand voice, create marketing and customer contact materials, and nail messaging themes for potential customers, business partnerships, and investors.
- [Doing Brand Analysis](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Doing/doing-analysis.md). This is the initial analyisis I did for Doing after meeting with their founders and staff, and researching the space they're in. **This is typical of what I provide my clients initially.**.
- ["You Are What You Do" blog post](https://blog.doing.io/you-are-what-you-do-e9da2d102709) (external link). This is a blog post I ghostwrote with edits from the team. The messaging and themes (namely "you are what you do") and the concepts presented in this post are my original work, done to help the team frame their narrative. This is a good example of using the above brand analysis to inform messaging themes.

## Simple

The majority of my experience and examples come from Simple. I worked at [Simple](https://simple.com) for five and a half years. During that time, I originated and curated Simple's brand voice through writing, mentoring writers, and editing every imaginable piece of writing and copy, large and small. Most importantly, I ran the effort to identify Simple's company values, and wrote Simple's style guides, which in turn set groundwork for training programs for Marketing and Customer Relations teams.

### The curated list.

For a quick version, I'll highlight some of the things I think best represent my work with Simple.

- [Simple's core writing values](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Big%20Stuff/styleguide.md). Basically, if our style guide or voice and tone compendium have falied to provide you an answer, here are the things to think about when you're making writing decisions.

- [Simple voice and tone](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Big%20Stuff/voiceandtone.md). Owing a big debt of gratitude to Mailchimp's [voiceandtone.com](http://voiceandtone.com/), this is Simple's version, which is a whole lot more detailed because in general, money is more likely to be an emotional subject than email marketing. There are 30 articles about different cases in which a person might have to write copy. A good example is [this one](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Big%20Stuff/Articles/Application.md) on writing copy for the application to become a customer.

- [An abbreviated style guide](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Nitty-Gritty/strunkyfresh.md). This has the most commonly-needed rules on when to use certain types of punctuation, grammar, and all that.
 
- [An apology blog post](https://www.simple.com/company/my-apology-to-you). As tech screw-up apologies have almost become a genre unto themselves, I was very proud of this post I ghostwrote for our CEO. It meant a lot to him to get it right, so he trusted me absolutely to make sure we did. This was a pretty huge mess, and the post needed to explain some complex technical concepts, assure customers their accounts were safe, and demonstrate a genuine understanding of the impact. 

- [A presentation on empathy](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/empathy2.pdf) (PDF). This ties together a bunch of research and some of our internal stuff for a talk on empathy. It focused a lot on customer service employees, who bear the brunt of empathy exhaustion, but was also given to people who design UX, write copy, or almost any customer-facing function. It talks about formulas and strategies for empathetic communication and design.

- [A presentation for the marketing team](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Voiceandtone.pdf) about how to talk to our audience, and how not to talk to anyone ever.

- [An early video ad for Simple](https://vimeo.com/160291191). (External link) I was instrumental in developing the concept for this ad, helped write and edit the script, and wrote the tagline at the end.

### The self-guided tour

Start [here](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Simple/Writing%20the%20Simple%20Way.md) for a directory representing what the How To Write repository looked like when I left Simple in May 2015. There are resources that give more of an overview of the philosophies of how we write, as well as specific examples of how to write copy for almost any occasion.

## Seed

Another useful set of guides that I have on hand as a good example of my work is the one I wrote for [Seed](https://seed.co). I was contracted to write marketing copy, do branding research, and help with job descriptions. As with many of my consulting gigs, I started with a quick writing guide and a document about overall messaging. I was later hired as a full-time employee to help guide the brand voice and direction.

- [Seed writing principles](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Seed/seed-writing.md). A basic guide detailing the principles of writing for Seed.
- [Seed brand background](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Seed/seed-working.md). Some of the ideas behind the writing guide.

## Blaak

Blaak pivoted completely, and renamed themselves to Vault, a retirement savings platform. They were recently acquired and are now [Acorns Later](https://www.acorns.com/acorns-later/). But back when they wanted to provide a [Betterment](http://www.betterment.com)- or [Wealthfront](http://www.wealthfront.com)-style personal investing service, I drafted [this](https://github.com/the-rachel/styles/blob/master/Blaak/blaak.md) document to help them with their writing and brand direction, and some of that spirit has remained with them even through their acquisition.
